# ðŸ”— Singly Linked List in Python

This project is a basic implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in Python. It demonstrates how nodes are connected using pointers and how operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal are manually handled.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Insert at beginning or end
- Delete elements by value
- Search for elements
- Display the list
- Check if the list is empty
- Built from scratch using nodes and pointers

## ðŸ“¦ Class: `LinkedList`

This implementation includes a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class to manage the linked structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
