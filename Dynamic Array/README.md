# ðŸ§  Dynamic Array in Python

This project is a basic implementation of a **Dynamic Array** (similar to Pythonâ€™s built-in list, but implemented manually to demonstrate internal mechanics like resizing, shifting, etc.).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Dynamically expands when capacity is reached
- Shrinks when array becomes too sparse
- Insert elements at any valid index
- Delete elements by value
- Linear search
- Display contents
- Check if array is empty

## ðŸ“¦ Class: `DynamicArray`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
