# Data-Structure
---
**Data Structure**: is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
1. Are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
2. Help to manage and organize data.
3. Make code cleaner and easier to understand.

**Abstract Data Structure**: is an abstraction of a data to which a data structure must adhere to.

**Examples**:
| Abstract Data Structure | Description                                 | Common Implementations      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Array                  | Collection of elements identified by index  | Static array, dynamic array |
| Stack                  | LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure          | Array, Linked List          |
| Queue                  | FIFO (First In, First Out) structure         | Array, Linked List          |
| Deque                  | Double-ended queue                           | Array, Doubly Linked List   |
| Linked List            | Sequence of nodes where each points to next | Singly, Doubly, Circular    |
| Tree                   | Hierarchical structure with parent-child     | Binary Tree, BST, Heap      |
| Graph                  | Set of nodes connected by edges              | Adjacency List, Matrix      |
| Hash Table             | Key-value pairs                              | Array with Hashing          |
| Set                    | Collection of unique elements                | Hash Table, BST             |
| Map / Dictionary       | Key-value mapping                            | Hash Table, Balanced Tree   |
