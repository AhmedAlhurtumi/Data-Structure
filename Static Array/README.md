# ðŸ§  Static Array in Python

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a **static array** in Python, encapsulated in a class `StaticArray`. The array has a fixed size and supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, display, and linear search.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Fixed-size array**: Simulates a static array with a size defined during initialization.
- **Insert element**: Adds an element at a specific index.
- **Delete element**: Removes an element from a specific index.
- **Linear search**: Searches for an element in the array.
- **Display array**: Prints the current state of the array with `None` for uninitialized positions.

## ðŸ“¦ Class: `StaticArray`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
